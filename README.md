# Django Hiring Blog

This project is an employment website implemented using Django. In this project, users can register and sign in to their accounts and edit their own profile. A company user can post job openings that list the details of the positions, and change the candidates' status as the hiring process goes. A candidate user can apply to a job post, and check on the hiring status under the post page.

A user can also search for posts on the search bar to filter the posts with designated keywords. A list of keywords is also provided on the right side of the home page to offer quick filtering.
